I am a third-year graduate student from School of Chemistry & Materials Scienceï¼Œ [Northwest University (China)](https://english.nwu.edu.cn/), majoring in materials and chemical industry.

In the past year, I cooperated with School of Microelectronics in [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) and focused on silicon-based semiconductor photoelectrocatalytic materials.<br>

I hope to research and develop solar cells during my Ph.D. Copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) is a promising thin film solar cell material. However, its short-wavelength response is limited by the buffer layer and transparent conducting oxide layer. Quantum dot (QD) such as ZnS, InP, graphene..., is expected to solve this problem by increasing the short-wavelength response. It works as a luminescent down-shifting layer: converts photons in the short-wavelength region and re-emits the photons at a longer wavelength region. In addition, QD has the advantages of adjustable band gap values, easy synthesis and high stability, which is expected to further improve the efficiency of CIGS solar cells.

Nano research: [Construction of Novel P-Si/TiO2/HfO2/MoS2/Pt Hetero-Photocathode for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting](https://www.sciopen.com/article/10.1007/s12274-023-6299-1)<br>

A kind of advanced p-Si/TiO2/HfO2/MoS2/Pt photocathode system is firstly fabricated through a stepwise deposition method. The best P-Si/TiO2/HfO2/MoS2/Pt photocathode demonstrates an initial potential of 0.5 V (vs. RHE) and a photocurrent density of -29 mA/cm2 at 0 V (vs. RHE). Through intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy and photoluminescence test, it is known that the enhanced water splitting performance is attributed to the optimized carrier transfer properties. The introduction of an ultra-thin HfO2 film not only effectively mitigates the corrosion of the silicon substrate, but also exhibits enhanced carrier transfer and suppressed carrier recombination. DFT calculations indicate the strong binding energy for Pt atoms on MoS2 layer, meaning that it should be energetically favorable for a Pt layer to form on MoS2 surfaces. Gibbs free energy and charge density difference also explained the enhanced catalytic properties of bi-component cocatalyst MoS2/Pt.
