I am a third-year graduate student from School of Chemistry & Materials Scienceï¼Œ [Northwest University (China)](https://english.nwu.edu.cn/). In the past year, I cooperated with School of Microelectronics in [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) and focused on silicon-based semiconductor photoelectrocatalytic materials. I hope to continue my research on semiconductors at the doctoral level.

Overview

Education
------
[2] SEP 2021-Now<br>
[Northwest University (China)](https://english.nwu.edu.cn/) > Chemistry and Materials Science > master degree in engineering

[1] SEP 2017-JUL 2021<br>
[Hefei University of Technology](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/) > Materials of Science and Engineering > bachelor's degree of engineering

Publication
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
