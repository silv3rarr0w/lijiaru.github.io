I am a third-year graduate student from School of Chemistry & Materials Scienceï¼Œ [Northwest University (China)](https://english.nwu.edu.cn/), majoring in materials and chemical industry.

In the past year, I cooperated with School of Microelectronics in [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) and focused on silicon-based semiconductor photoelectrocatalytic materials. I hope to continue my research on semiconductor materials at the doctoral level.

Publication
------
Nano research:[Construction of Novel P-Si/TiO2/HfO2/MoS2/Pt Hetero-Photocathode for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting](https://www.sciopen.com/article/10.1007/s12274-023-6299-1)<br>
A kind of advanced p-Si/TiO2/HfO2/MoS2/Pt photocathode system is firstly fabricated through a stepwise deposition method. The introduction of an ultra-thin HfO2 film not only effectively mitigates the corrosion of the silicon substrate, but also exhibits enhanced carrier transfer and suppressed carrier recombination.
